Preparing the revolution
Seizing the means of production
Purging counter-revolutionaries
Eating the rich
The dictatorship of the proletariat is inevitable
From each according to their ability, to each according to their needs
Building a better world for all
The struggle continues
Bread, peace, and land
Abolishing private property
The working class has nothing to lose but their chains
Uniting against imperialism
Workers of the world, unite!
Creating a world without borders
The bourgeoisie trembles at the thought of communism
The people's power will prevail
Proletarians of all countries, unite!
The working class is the true agent of history
The capitalist system is in crisis
Communism is the solution
Rejecting neoliberalism and austerity
Imperialism is the highest stage of capitalism
Capitalism breeds inequality and oppression
For a world where human needs come before profits
The struggle for socialism is a struggle for human liberation
